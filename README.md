# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
This analysis is seeking to compare the fares each week across city types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) using a line graph. The comparison using this visual will inform PyBer's continued ride share operations.

## Results
The three city types show significantly differing rates by week for January through May, as indicated by a lack in overlap between the lines on the graph. Urban areas have distinctly higher fares, Rural areas have the lowest fares, and Suburban area fares are in between the other two.
