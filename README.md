# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose

This analysis is seeking to compare the fares each week across city types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) using a line graph. 
### Why this is important
The comparison using this visual will inform PyBer's continued ride share operations.

## Results

The three city types show significantly differing rates by week for January through May, as indicated by a lack in overlap between the lines on the graph. Urban areas have distinctly higher fares, Rural areas have the lowest fares, and Suburban area fares are in between the other two. 

- Rural cities
  - 125 Total Rides
  - 78 Total Drivers
  - $4,327.93 in Total Fares
  - $34.62 Average Fare per Ride
  - $55.49 Average Fare per Driver
- Suburban cities
  - 625 Total Rides
  - 490 Total Drivers
  - $19,356.33 in Total Fares
  - $30.97 Average Fare Per Ride
  - $39.50 Average Fare per Driver
- Urban cities
  - 1,625 Total Rides
  - 2,405 Total Drivers
  - $39,854.38 in Total Fares
  - $24.53 Average Fare Per Ride
  - $16.57 Average Fare per Driver

## Summary

In light of the unique fare lines on the above graph, PyBer may want to consider some recommendations in response to ensure they are running efficiently and meeting the needs of each city type.

### Recommendation 1

With rates low in Rural areas, there may be some advantage of looking into alternative ways to provide ride sharing services. It may behoove PyBer to look into multiple-rider types of ride sharing, by having a driver pick up several individuals at once. This may then allow the ride share to branch out into commuting services where multiple individuals from one workplace are able to commute together from a Rural location into an Urban one, and back again at close of business each day.

### Recommendation 2

An ad campaign to increase the amount of drivers in the Urban settings where the fares are the highest would likely increase the amount of fares collected in this high earning city type. 

### Recommendation 3

Suburban areas may be choosing to utilize personal vehicles rather than getting a ride share service for most errands due to the close and readily available food, grocery, and other services in Suburban areas. If PyBer were able to branch out services in this area to include obtaining and delivering goods (i.e. obtaining groceries froma store and delivering them to the person's home) they may see an increase in fares. While their fares would be for objects and food items rather than people, it may meet a unique niche that Suburban areas have which is unique to their geography.
